## Motivation

This project was inspired by a humorous take from popular culture (hello *Silicon Valley*) where the question is simply: **Hot dog or not?**  
Hot Dog Detector is meant to be lightweight, fun, and a way to explore image classification, transfer learning, deployment, and user experience.

## Features

- Accepts image input (upload or camera)  
- Detects presence of **hot dog** vs **not hot dog**  
- Confidence score for each prediction  
- Friendly responses (e.g. ‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs a hot dog!‚Äù or ‚ÄúNope, no frankfurter here.‚Äù)  
- Optional: live demo / mobile-friendly UI
